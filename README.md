# MAVLink Router

Route mavlink packets between endpoints.

The usual configuration is to have one connection to the flight stack (either
on UART or UDP) and other components that can be on UDP or TCP or UART
endpoints. This is not strictly required and other configurations are possible:
mavlink-router mainly routes mavlink packets from one endpoint to the other
endpoints without differentiating what they are. However the user is still able
to differentiate them by targeting just a subset of the packets by using
message filters.

TCP endpoints are added automatically if the TCP server is enabled, allowing
clients to simply connect to mavlink-router without changing its configuration.


## Compilation and Installation

In order to compile you need the following packages:

  - GCC or Clang compiler
  - meson >= 0.57 and ninja-build
  - C and C++ standard libraries

### Fetch dependencies

We currently depend on the mavlink C library. The corresponding submodule
should be fetched:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

We need some additional packages as build dependencies. Packages for some
distros:

Debian/Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt install git meson ninja-build pkg-config gcc g++ systemd

Fedora:

    $ sudo dnf install git meson gcc g++ systemd

Archlinux:

    $ sudo pacman -S git meson gcc systemd

Note that meson package must be version 0.55 or later. If your package manager
does not have this version, a more recent version can be downloaded via pip:

    $ sudo pip3 install meson

If using this method, meson must _not_ be installed with ``--user``.

### Build

The build system follows the usual configure/build/install cycle.
Configuration is needed to be done only once.

A typical configuration for a x86-64 system is shown below:

    $ meson setup build .

By default systemd integration is enabled. In a system without systemd you
should pass the service directory with `-Dsystemdsystemunitdir=/usr/lib/systemd/system`.
By default the build type is settled to "debugoptimized". It can be changed
with `--buildtype=release`, see [Meson documentation](https://mesonbuild.com/Builtin-options.html#core-options)
for more options.

Installation location can be changed using the -Dprefix option to `meson setup`.

Build:

    $ ninja -C build

Install:

    $ sudo ninja -C build install

Or in order to install to another root directory:

    $ sudo DESTDIR=/tmp/root/dir ninja -C build install


## Running

There are two ways to configure mavlink-router which can be used in
combination: Configuration file(s) and command line parameters. The
configuration file has a more fine-grained control (and is used by the systemd
unit) while the CLI options enable a quick setup of endpoints.

### Conf File

By default, mavlink-routerd looks for a file `/etc/mavlink-router/main.conf`.
The file location can be overriden via a `MAVLINK_ROUTER_CONF_FILE` environment
variable, or via the `-c` CLI switch when running mavlink-routerd. An example
conf file can be found in [examples/config.sample](examples/config.sample).

### Conf Directory

Besides the default conf file, it's also possible to use a directory in where
to put some extra configuration files. Files in this directory will be read in
alphabetical order, and can add or override configurations found in previous
files.

By default, `/etc/mavlink-router/config.d` is the directory, but it can be
overriden via a `MAVLINK_ROUTER_CONF_DIR` environment variable, or via the `-d`
switch when running mavlink-routerd.

### CLI Parameters

Please see the output of `mavlink-routerd --help` for the full list of command
line options. The most important facts are:

  - The TCP server is enabled by default
  - TCP and UDP endpoints can be added multiple times
  - UDP endpoints added with the `-e` option are started in `normal` mode
    (sending data to the specified address and port)
  - The last parameter (without a key) can either be one UART device or an UDP
    connection. This UDP endpoint will be started in `server` mode (waiting for
    an incoming connection)!


To route mavlink packets from UART `ttyS1` to 2 other UDP endpoints, use the
following command:

    $ mavlink-routerd -e 192.168.7.1:14550 -e 127.0.0.1:14550 /dev/ttyS1:1500000

The `1500000` after the colon in `/dev/ttyS1:1500000` sets the UART baudrate.
See more options with `mavlink-routerd --help`.

It's also possible to route mavlinks packets from an incoming UDP connection
instead of UART:

    $ mavlink-routerd -e 192.168.7.1:14550 -e 127.0.0.1:14550  0.0.0.0:24550

Additionally, mavlink-router also listens on port 5760 for TCP connections by
default. Any client connecting to that port will be able to send and receive
MAVLink data.

IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets like this: `[::1]`. The port
number can be specified in the same way, as with IPv4 then: `[::1]:14550`. Both
unicast and multicast addresses should be handled properly and the interface
for a link-local address is auto-detected.


## Detailed Description of Capabilities

Here are some more detailes on the additional capabilities of mavlink-router.

### Endpoint Configuration

A description of the different endpoint operating modes and their configuration
parameters can be found in the [examples/config.sample](examples/config.sample).

### Flight Stack Logging

Mavlink router can also collect flight stack logs. It supports collecting both
PX4 and Ardupilot flight stacks logs. To start logging, set a directory to the
`Log` key in the `General` section in the config file (or use argument option
`-l`). The MAVLink dialect will be auto-detected by default, or can be set
explictly using the `MavlinkDialect` key. For instance, to collect Ardupilot
logs to `/var/log/flight-stack` directory, one could add to the conf file:

    [General]
    Log=/var/log/flight-stack
    MavlinkDialect=ardupilotmega

Logs are collected on `.bin` (for Ardupilot) or `.ulg` (for PX4) files in the
specified directory. Note that they are named `XXXXX-date-time`, where `XXXXX`
is an increasing number.


## Contributing

Pull-requests are accepted on GitHub.
Make sure to check coding style with the provided script in `tools/checkpatch`
and `tools/checkpython`, check for memory leaks with valgrind and test on real
hardware.

To test the software, run the unit tests using `ninja -C build test` (the
googletest library must be installed using your package manager first).

To check the compiled binary, the `tests/routing_test.py` script runs the
actual mavlink-routerd binary and checks some basic routing rules.


## Samples

Directory `examples` has some samples that can be used to test mavlink-router.
Those are Python scripts, and [pymavlink](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink)
is required.


### Sender & Receiver

One can test mavlink-router by using `examples/sender.py` and
`examples/receiver.py` to simulate traffic of mavlink messages. First script
sends mavlink *ping* messages to a target mavlink system-id, and second
receives and responds to them. For instance:

    $ python3 examples/sender.py 127.0.0.1:3000 100 0

Will send mavlink *pings* to UDP port 3000. Those pings will have `100` as
source system id and will have `0` as target system id (`0` means broadcast).
Receiver could be set as:

    $ python3 examples/receiver.py 127.0.0.1:4000 50

Where `50` is the receiver system id. Then, to route between those:

    $ mavlink-routerd -e 127.0.0.1:4000 0.0.0.0:3000

Note that it's possible to setup multiple senders and receivers to see
mavlink-router in action.
